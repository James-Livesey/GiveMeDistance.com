                <h2>Why have awareness badges for vulnerable people?</h2>
                <p class="bold">
                    Being in public places during the coronavirus outbreak can
                    make people feel nervous. But having a I'm part of a Vulnerable
                    Group badge makes it easier to let other people know you have
                    a good reason for needing to keep your distance.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The government has not yet asked people from vulnerable groups
                    (people with underlying health conditions such as diabetes, asthma and
                    heart problems, and the over 70's) to self-isolate. Concerned for our
                    relatives - who are part of this vulnerable group - especially when they
                    are out in public, whether that's at work or school, or just popping to the
                    shop, we thought an awareness badge might help.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Inspired by the Transport for London's 'Baby on board' badges that
                    make people aware when pregnant women travel on the tube, we came
                    up with the idea of a badge that informs the public that they are part
                    of a vulnerable group, meaning they have a higher chance of developing
                    severe illness if coronavirus is contracted, compared to the rest of the
                    population.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The badge would raise awareness, and request giving vulnerable people distance.
                    It will hopefully also act as a visual reminder that continues to raise
                    awareness about the need to be vigilant and <strong>keep washing our hands</strong>. Health
                    scientists say keeping <strong>at least 2 metres apart</strong> makes it less likely that
                    someone will be infected by the virus when face to face, as it can be carried in tiny droplets from the nose or mouth when sneezing or coughing.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We appreciate that social distancing is not ideal, as most of us humans
                    are sociable creatures. But in these strange times, this could make a
                    difference to vulnerable people's concerns when out in public places
                    where they can come into close contact with the public. Especially
                    because not all vulnerabilities are obvious or visible.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We've made the badge template easy to use, simply print off on a sheet of
                    labels or print off on A4 paper, cut it out and attach it with a pin onto your coat
                    (like you would with a poppy) or stick it on.
