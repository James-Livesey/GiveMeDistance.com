                <h2>Why have awareness badges for vulnerable people?</h2>
                <p>
                    The government has not yet asked people from vulnerable groups
                    (people with underlying health conditions such as diabetes, asthma and
                    heart problems, and the over 70's) to self-isolate. However, we feel
                    concerned about our relatives ─ who are part of this vulnerable group ─
                    especially when they are out in public, whether that's at work or school,
                    or just popping to the shop, so we thought an awareness badge may be
                    of help.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Inspired by the Transport for London's 'Baby on board' badges that
                    make people aware when a pregnant women is travelling on a tube, we
                    came up with the idea of wearing a badge that informs the public they
                    are part of a vulnerable group, meaning they have a higher chance of
                    developing severe illness if coronavirus is contracted, compared to the
                    rest of the population.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The badge would raise awareness to the public, requesting they give
                    vulnerable people distance. It will hopefully also act as a visual reminder
                    that continues to raise awareness about the need to be vigilant and keep
                    washing our hands. Many scientists around the globe say keeping at
                    least <strong>2 metres apart</strong> makes it less likely that someone will be infected by
                    the virus, as it can be carried in tiny droplets from the nose or mouth
                    when sneezing or coughing.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We appreciate that social distancing is not ideal, as humans are sociable
                    beings. But in these worrying times, it could make a difference to
                    vulnerable people's concerns when out in public places where they can
                    come into close contact with the public. Especially because, not all
                    vulnerabilities are obvious or visible.
